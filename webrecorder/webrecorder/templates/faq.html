                <h4 class='q'>What are Web Archives?</h4>
                <p class='a'>
                    A web archive is a record of web resources. It may include HTML and images, scripts, stylesheets, as well as video, audio and other elements that web pages and web apps are made of, all in one file.<BR>
                </p>

                <h4 class='q'>What makes Webrecorder different?</h4>
                <p class='a'>
                    What most differentiates Webrecorder is its focus on "dynamic web content." The web once delivered documents, like HTML pages. Today, it delivers complex software customized for every user, like individualized social media feeds. Other existing digital preservation solutions were built for that earlier time and cannot adequately cope with what the web has become. Webrecorder, by contrast, focuses on all that dynamic content, such as embedded video and complex javascript, addressing our present and future.

                <h4 class='q'>How do I use Webrecorder?</h4>

                <h4 class='q'>Who created Webrecorder?</h4>
                <p class='a'>

                <h4 class='q'>What's Rhizome?</h4>
                <p class='a'>
                    Founded on the internet in 1996, Rhizome is a non-profit organization which commissions, presents, and preserves digital art. Since 2003, Rhizome has been an independent affiliate in residence at the <a href='http://newmuseum.org/' target='_blank'>New Museum</a> in New York City, and is based at <a href='http://www.newinc.org/' target='_blank'>NEW INC</a>, the first museum-led incubator. As it happens, to preserve net art you need to build complex things that can capture complex things.
                </p>
