This is the official repository of the Webrecorder web archiving platform: https://webrecorder.io/

Webrecorder provides an integrated platform for creating high-fidelity web archives while browsing, sharing,
and disseminating archived content.

Users may try the service anonymously or login and create a permanent online archive.

Webrecorder will support multiple backends and will integrate with existing preservation systems.

For best experience, please try Webrecorder at https://webrecorder.io/


### Running Locally

Webrecorder can be run using Docker and Docker Compose. See [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on installing Docker. See [Docker Compose Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for installing Compose.

1). `git clone https://github.com/webrecorder/webrecorder`

2).  `cd webrecorder; bash init-default.sh`.

3). `docker-compose build`

4). `docker-compose up -d`

(The `init-default.sh` is a convenience script that copies [wr_sample.env](webrecorder/webrecorder/config/wr_sample.env) -> `wr.env` and creates keys for session encryption.)

Point your browser to port `http://<DOCKER HOST>:8089/` to view the Webrecorder.

### Configuration

Webrecorder is fully configured from `wr.yaml`, which includes full settings for the application and various containers.

Archived data (WARCs) are stored locally under the `./data/` directory, and all metadata and user info is stored in a persistent Redis instance.

Useful environment and deployment settings are loaded from `wr.env` and can be overriden per-deployment.

Following are a few of these settings:

#### Storage

The `DEFAULT_STORAGE` option in `wr.env` configures storage options. Default is just the local file system.

Currently, `s3` is also supported. To use s3, set `DEFAULT_STORAGE=s3` and fill in the additional auth settings in `wr.env`

With default local storage, archived data is kept in the `./data/warcs` directory only.


#### Mail

Webrecorder sends invitiation, confirmation and lost password emails. By default, a local SMTP server is run in Docker, however, this can be configured to use a remote server by changing `EMAIL_SMTP_URL` and `EMAIL_SMTP_SENDER`.

#### Invites

By default, Webrecorder allows anyone with access to the web site to register for an account. However, users may wish to limit
registration to specifically invited users.

To require invites, simply set `REQUIRE_INVITES=true`

#### Administration tool

The `admin.py` script provides easy low level management of users. Add, modify and remove users along with creating and managing invites.

To interactively create a user:
`docker exec -it webrecorder_app_1 python -m webrecorder.admin -c`
or programmatically add users by supplying the appropriate positional values:
`... python -m webrecorder.admin -c <email> <username> <passwd> <role> '<full name>'`

Other arguments:

* `-m` modify a user
* `-d` delete a user
* `-i` create and send a new invite
* `-l` list invited users
* `-b` send backlogged invites

See `docker exec -it webrecorder_app_1 python -m webrecorder.admin --help` for full details.

### Updating Deployment

When making changes to Webrecorder, running `docker-compose build; docker-compose up -d` will restart all of the containers.

To restart only the Webrecorder container, use the `./rebuild.sh` script.

### Architecture

Webrecorder is built using a variety of open-source tools and uses [pywb](https://github.com/ikreymer/pywb), Redis and Nginx. It is written in Python and uses the [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html), [Cork](http://cork.firelet.net/), [Webassets](https://webassets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) frameworks. It runs with [Gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) and [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
